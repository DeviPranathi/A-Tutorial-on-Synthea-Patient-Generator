Synthea Patient Generator Tutorial

This project provides a comprehensive tutorial on using Synthea, an open-source synthetic patient data generator, to simulate healthcare data for research and analysis. The study focuses on generating a synthetic cohort of 300 female patients aged 30-60 from Dallas, Texas, to explore healthcare consumption trends, chronic disease prevalence, and medication usage patterns. By configuring Syntheaâ€™s command-line parameters, we tailored the simulation to produce patient data in CSV, FHIR, and C-CDA formats for further analysis. The generated data was examined using statistical methods to identify chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and mental health disorders, along with healthcare utilization trends like primary care and emergency visits. Additionally, graphical visualizations such as disease pathways, medication trends, and healthcare resource allocation were used to interpret key insights. This study highlights the value of synthetic health data in public health research, policy modeling, and healthcare analytics while ensuring privacy compliance. The tutorial outlines the configuration steps, data generation process, and analytical techniques used, making it a valuable resource for researchers, healthcare professionals, and data scientists interested in health data simulation and analysis.
